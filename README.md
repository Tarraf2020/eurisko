  ### missing parts of the projects
    1. fetching more data when scrolling to the end ( the same of scrollUp button but repeat the api call with page++ and add the new data to the old ones in the article state or redux store)
    2. search (filtering data from an array of data that is stored in the redux store)
    3. get article by ID (send any unique data as props and filter the from the redux store to get the specific data of the article itself)
    4. get articles by category or tags or...
    5. testing (using jest enzymes)
    
  ### Conclusion
    To be honest, i had some problems with my senior and he gave me a load of tasks to do and its all because i asked for 2 days so i can work on the project. This piece of art was made in 30 consecutive hours with no sleep and learning new stuff as Redux (i use functional hooks).
    Maybe i can ask for a tech interview to prove myself, and especially to prove my will to learn new things and gaining more experience.
